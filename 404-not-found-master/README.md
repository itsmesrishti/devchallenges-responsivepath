<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](404-page.png)

- **Where can I see your demo?**<br>
  You can see me demo here: https://devchallenges-responsivepath-project1.netlify.app/
  
- **What was your experience?**<br>
  The experience was fun and a little bit taxing trying to make the text and image adjust in such a way that neither is disproportionately bigger than the other.
  
- **What have you learned/improved?**<br>
  I even made the image responsive and I learned that sometimes the solution is simple silly.
  
- **Your wisdom? :)**<br>
  Sometimes, the solution is simple, you don't have to think or try too hard.
