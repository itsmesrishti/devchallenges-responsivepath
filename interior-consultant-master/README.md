## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Jymh2b2FyebRTUljkNcb) was to build a landing page for an interior consultant. Had to translate the Figma design into code, create a hamburger menu for mobiles, and add functionality to the hamburger menu.
