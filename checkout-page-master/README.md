## Overview

![screenshot]()

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- **Where can I see your demo?**<br>
  You can see my demo here: [live version](https://devchallenges-responsivepath-project6.netlify.app/)
  
- **What was your experience?**<br>
  I enjoyed creating the checkout page and figuring out how to give the user a chance to increase or decrease the number of items in the cart. And how to change the total price each time a new item is added or removed. 
  
- **What have you learned/improved?**<br>
  I don't know if the challenge creator wanted the user to input the number of items directly by letting them type in a number or by using the plus and minus button but I did the latter. If the former is what the challenge creator wanted then I added a new feature using which users can add or remove as many items as they want by using the plus/minus buttons.

  I added this new feature where each time a user adds or removes an item from the cart the total price gets updated.
