- **Where can I see your demo?**<br>
  You can see the live version of the project here: https://devchallenges-responsivepath-project2.netlify.app/
  
- **What was your experience?**<br>
  It was a fun little design project different from what I've built until now.
  
- **What have you learned/improved?**<br>
  I improved my skills of working with CSS Grids.

  Working with CSS Grids isn't as scary as you think and in fact you can create some fun designs with it.
